# Bollinger Bands Arbitrage Backtest

This repository contains a **fully-automated backtest** implementation
of a *Bollinger Bands Arbitrage Strategy* written in Python.\
It uses `pandas_ta` for indicator computation and `matplotlib` for
visual performance evaluation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìñ Strategy Overview

The **Bollinger Bands Arbitrage Strategy** assumes mean-reverting price
behavior.\
The model trades **toward the mean** when volatility (ATR) is
sufficiently high, using **Bollinger Bands** as reference zones.

### Core Idea

Prices fluctuate like a *noisy sine wave* around their mean. The middle
Bollinger Band represents this mean, while outer bands capture
statistical extremes.

**Entry Logic:** - Long when price crosses **above the middle band**
with sufficient ATR\
- Short when price crosses **below the middle band** with sufficient ATR

**Exit Logic:** - Long exits at the **upper band** - Short exits at the
**lower band**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

-   Clean, class-based architecture (`BollingerBandsBacktest`)
-   Built-in data loading and trade recording
-   Daily segmented execution for 1-minute OHLC data
-   ATR-based volatility filter
-   Full trade statistics and graphical evaluation
-   Automated performance report with:
    -   Win rate
    -   Average drawdown
    -   Average duration
    -   Cumulative performance plots

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß† Notes & Insights

This model is **highly profitable** on long historical backtests (15
years of 1-minute NQ data), showing an *extremely high Sharpe ratio*.\
However, it also demonstrates why **statistical arbitrage is fragile**:

> Small deviations in execution cost assumptions (spread, fees,
> slippage) can destroy returns.

No stop-loss is used --- exits are **price-adjusted** through the outer
Bollinger Bands.\
While this keeps the win rate high, it creates **large floating
drawdowns** and **poor risk-adjusted efficiency** in real-world
conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß© Usage

``` bash
pip install pandas pandas_ta numpy matplotlib
```

Then execute:

``` bash
python main.py
```

The script automatically runs the full process: 1. Load data from
`NQ_OHLC_1m.csv` 2. Backtest with BB(26, 2.2) and ATR(14) 3. Evaluate
and save plots as `eval_BB26_2.2.png`
